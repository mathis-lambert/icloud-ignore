# iCloud Ignore (`icignore`)

`icignore` is a small command-line utility for **selectively excluding folders from iCloud synchronization** on macOS.
It leverages the `.nosync` suffix recognized by macOS, while keeping folder access seamless through symbolic links, so apps and Finder keep working as before.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Ignore: `icignore ignore <folder>` renames to `<name>.nosync` and creates a symlink back.
- Unignore: `icignore unignore <folder>` removes the symlink and renames back.
- Status: `icignore status <folder>` shows symlink + real directory status.
- Safe-by-default: refuses destructive overwrites and supports `--dry-run`.
- Homebrew-friendly: single static binary with formula and releases.

## üöÄ Installation

### Using Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap mathis-lambert/icloud-ignore
brew install icignore
```

---

## üîß Usage

### Exclude a folder

```bash
icignore ignore ~/Documents/Projects
```

Effect:

* The folder is renamed to `Projects.nosync` (ignored by iCloud).
* A symbolic link `Projects` is recreated at the same location ‚Üí Finder and apps continue to work as before.

---

### Check folder status

```bash
icignore status ~/Documents/Projects
```

Example output:

```
SYMLINK: /Users/username/Documents/Projects -> Projects.nosync
REAL: /Users/username/Documents/Projects.nosync (excluded from iCloud via .nosync suffix)
```

---

### Restore sync

```bash
icignore unignore ~/Documents/Projects
```

Effect:

* Removes the symbolic link.
* Renames `Projects.nosync` back to `Projects`.
* The folder resumes syncing with iCloud.

## üì¶ Release & Homebrew

Tagged releases are built and published via GoReleaser. The Homebrew tap repository is updated automatically.

- Source repo: `mathis-lambert/icloud-ignore`
- Tap repo: `mathis-lambert/homebrew-icloud-ignore`

Release process:
- Merge changes to `main` and update docs.
- Tag a version: `git tag v0.x.y && git push origin v0.x.y`
- GitHub Actions runs GoReleaser to publish archives and update the tap.

Maintainer setup (once):
- Create a Personal Access Token (classic) with `repo` scope and add it as a secret in this repo named `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`.
  - It must have write access to both repositories above.
- The workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` uses this token to publish releases and push the formula to the tap.

Manual release (local):

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_pat_with_repo_scope> make release
```

Tap name: `mathis-lambert/icloud-ignore` (backed by repo `homebrew-icloud-ignore`).
