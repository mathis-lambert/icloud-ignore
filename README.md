# iCloud Ignore (`icignore`)

`icignore` is a small command-line utility for **selectively excluding folders from iCloud synchronization** on macOS.
It leverages the `.nosync` suffix recognized by macOS, while keeping folder access seamless through symbolic links, so apps and Finder keep working as before.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Ignore: `icignore ignore <folder>` renames to `<name>.nosync` and creates a symlink back.
- Unignore: `icignore unignore <folder>` removes the symlink and renames back.
- Status: `icignore status <folder>` shows symlink + real directory status.
- Safe-by-default: refuses destructive overwrites and supports `--dry-run`.
- Homebrew-friendly: single static binary with formula and releases.

## üöÄ Installation

### Using Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap mathis-lambert/icloud-ignore
brew install icignore
```

### Install latest (HEAD)

```bash
brew tap mathis-lambert/icloud-ignore
brew install --HEAD icignore
```

---

## üîß Usage

### Exclude a folder

```bash
icignore ignore ~/Documents/Projects
```

Effect:

* The folder is renamed to `Projects.nosync` (ignored by iCloud).
* A symbolic link `Projects` is recreated at the same location ‚Üí Finder and apps continue to work as before.

---

### Check folder status

```bash
icignore status ~/Documents/Projects
```

Example output:

```
SYMLINK: /Users/username/Documents/Projects -> Projects.nosync
REAL: /Users/username/Documents/Projects.nosync (excluded from iCloud via .nosync suffix)
```

---

### Restore sync

```bash
icignore unignore ~/Documents/Projects
```

Effect:

* Removes the symbolic link.
* Renames `Projects.nosync` back to `Projects`.
* The folder resumes syncing with iCloud.

## üì¶ Release & Homebrew

Tagged releases are built and published via Goreleaser. A Homebrew tap is updated automatically.

1. Ensure your changes are merged to `main` and docs are updated.
2. Tag a version: `git tag v0.x.y && git push origin v0.x.y`
3. GitHub Actions will run Goreleaser to publish archives and update the tap.

Manual build:

```bash
make release   # requires goreleaser installed and GH token
```

Tap name: `mathis-lambert/icloud-ignore` (backed by repo `homebrew-icloud-ignore`).
